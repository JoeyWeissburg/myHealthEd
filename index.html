<h3><a name="project-introduction" class="anchor" href="#project-introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is MyHealthEd?</h3>
	<p>MyHealthEd is a tailored online sexual health learning tool for middle and high school students in rural North Carolina. Although required by North Carolina 
	law, many students do not receive a comprehensive sexual health education. This leads to a higher rate of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in 
	rural parts of North Carolina. The purpose of MyHealthEd is to provide an accessible source of sexual health information online that is tailored for each student.
	A prototype is planned to pilot in five rural public schools in spring 2014.</p>
		
	<p>The project is currently being developed on three fronts: the curriculum, the online tool, and the research to evaluate its effectiveness. This Github page and
	associated code repository is home base for the online software. The primary goals are to create web-based activities based on the North Carolina standards in 
	sexual education. The scope of portion developed here may grow throughout through the second half of the year.</p>
		
	<p>The content presented on this site is concerned primarily with the online activies and web tools. To learn more about MyHealthEd, visit the

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
